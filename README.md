# Day-1-Expanding-Cards
Day 1 of 50 Projects in 50 Days. A gallery of paintings by one of my favorite historical artists, John William Waterhouse.

I learned a lot about flexbox while creating this project. As an avid user of CSS libraries such as Bootstrap, I haven't 
paid much attention to manipulating vanilla CSS. Prior to this project, I did not know the function of a NodeList, but now
I know that it can be manipulated as an array. This project has inspired me to learn more about the capabilities of 
vanilla CSS, and I am excited to see what else this course will teach me.
